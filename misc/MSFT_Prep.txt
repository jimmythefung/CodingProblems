Interview 1
-Given a graph that represents build dependency (of a project, or program), print them in order.
-Two linked lists are partially merged. Given that two linked list, return the merge point
-Given a gameboard of "Connect 4", determine if there's a winner. (Also think about how to represent gameboard)
-Convert string to float (atof).

Interview 2
-Kth nearest problem
-Given a binary representation of a value, return the position of the first occruance of set bit
-Describe how would you find all the occruance of a substring in a super long string in a computer with 100 processor cores.
-Given a binary search tree, encode it into an array, and reconstruct the tree from the array

Interview 3
-You are given a function draw(x,y) that draws a pixel on the computer screen. Given a the radius R of a circle, write a function that draws it.
-Kth nearest problem
-Word chain problem (look it up)
-Write a function that evaluates a polynomial
