# Robot in a grid:  
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limit" such that the robot cannot step on them.  
Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from top left to the bottom right.  

# Idea  
Idea 1: DFS right, down, left, up.  
Idea 2: BFS to find shortest path.
