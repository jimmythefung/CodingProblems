## Problem Statement  
Given n > 0 fair dice with m > 0 "sides", write an function that returns a histogram of the frequency of the result of dice rolls. For example, for two dice, each with three sides, the results are: 

(1, 1) -> 2 
(1, 2) -> 3 
(1, 3) -> 4 
(2, 1) -> 3 
(2, 2) -> 4 
(2, 3) -> 5 
(3, 1) -> 4 
(3, 2) -> 5 
(3, 3) -> 6 

And the function should return: 

2: 1 
3: 2 
4: 3 
5: 2 
6: 1
