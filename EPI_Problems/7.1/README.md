## Interconvert String and Integers 
Be able to convert from string to integer and vice versa.  
Impletement **mystoi** and **myitos**, respectively.  
  
Hint - treat one integer at a time.  
  
## mystoi  
Insight:  
    - obtain integer using offset from the ASCII char '0'  
    - obtain correct base10's position, i,  using pow(10, i)  
  
## myitos  
Insight:  
    - obtain correct value of base10's position by finding the remainder using mod 10. i.e remainder = 496 % 10 = 6  
  
## Misc  
Though not neccessary, take notes of casting/conversion between char, int, size_t.
